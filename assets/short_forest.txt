Once upon a time, in a deep forest far away, there lived many animals. The forest was green and beautiful. Birds sang in the trees every morning. A small river ran through the forest, providing fresh water for all the creatures. The deer would come to drink at dawn. The rabbits played in the meadow. The wise old owl watched over everyone from his tall oak tree. In winter, snow covered the ground like a white blanket. In spring, flowers bloomed everywhere. The forest was a magical place where all animals lived together in harmony. They helped each other and shared the forest's bounty. This was their home, and they protected it with care.
